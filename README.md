Conversational chatbot the recieves microphone and desktop transcribed input as prompts and TTS's a response, output can be dramatically improved by using a fine-tuned openAI model (example included in data/finetuning/finetuning.txt).

To setup:
Clone the repository, create a .env file in the root directory (same directory as the driver file), and add in your openai api key in .env as "OPENAI_API_KEY=you_api_key"

Why the name?: Idk my friends named it
